# React-Use-State

When we use react with useHooks and use state,
Many snippets supplying just normal snippet.

So mostly snippets make like this.
```
"const [ $1, set$1 ] = React.useState();"
```
but this is not good to camelCase.

So I made it like

Make setter to CamelCase!!

This will be help for make setter on React.useState;

When we use useState with camelCase, we need to modify setter's name toUpperCase,

But this is can not ordered with default snippet, so I made it

If you select or have clipboard, ( like hello )

this will make to "setHello"

Done.
