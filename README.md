# React-Use-State

## Now only using for me

### So have not any description

#### Sorry, But I will make this more powerful

---

This will be help for make setter on React.useState;

When we use useState with camelCase, we need to modify setter's name toUpperCase,

But this is can not ordered with default snippet, so I made it

If you select or have clipboard, ( like hello )

this will make to "setHello"

Done.
